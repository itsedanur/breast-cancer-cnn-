#  Breast Cancer Classification with CNN & Transfer Learning

This project focuses on **classifying breast cancer images as benign or malignant** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning techniques with Keras and TensorFlow.

## Dataset

The dataset is structured as:

data/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ benign/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ malignant/
â”œâ”€â”€ val/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ benign/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ malignant/
â””â”€â”€ test/
â”œâ”€â”€ benign/
â””â”€â”€ malignant/



The original dataset is split into train/val/test using a custom script (`split_dataset.py`).

# Model Performances

Confusion matrices are plotted for each model:
-  Basic CNN: Accuracy ~ 69%
- Transfer Learning: Accuracy ~ 42%
-  Fine-Tuning: Accuracy ~ 51%

You can find them in the evaluation scripts.
